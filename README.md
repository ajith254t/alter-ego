   An immersive AI platform that enables users to create a persistent alternative personality for their chatbot. During a “Naming Ceremony,” users define the AI’s name, role, tone, and knowledge domain. This identity is injected into the backend as a dynamic system prompt, ensuring the AI consistently responds in character.The core innovation lies in its personality engine, which prepends structured identity instructions before user messages. This transforms a standard large language model into a controlled, persona-driven conversational system that maintains tone, discipline, and character integrity throughout interactions.Built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, the platform integrates Groq’s Llama 3.1 model for free cloud-based AI inference and is deployed on Vercel using secure environment variables.
